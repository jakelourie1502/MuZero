MCTS
0.1 seconds gets about 40 iterations on MCTS - we probably want more like 50 so let's go with 0.15 seconds. 
this would get through 2m frames in 3 days, ignoring the training time. maybe quicker on amazon computer

Notes on training:

for data point 1 in the K =5 training examples:
- the observation is fed into the representation function and returns a hidden state.
- the prediction function then predicts the policy and future value of that state. The future value of that state is never used in order to make a move.
- there is an action chosen, and the dynamics function predicts the reward and next state.
- we want to learn the representation, prediction and dynamics function so we can train 
predicted_R versus real_r
predicted_V versus real_V
predicted_pol versus real_policy

for data point 2 in the K = 5 training examples
- the observation is fed into the representation function and returns a hidden state
- this state is then fed into a dynamics function and returns a new hidden state
- prediction function predicts policy and future val
- action chosen by a new dynamics function and we get reward from this. 

so, for each of the k = 5.
re-calculate how many steps to do by looking at done function (e.g. if done[2] == True, k = 3)
state = representation(obs)
for _ in range(k):
    _ state = dynamics(obs)
policy, v = prediction(state)
reward, _ = dynamics(obs)

loss = MSE of policy, v and reward.
